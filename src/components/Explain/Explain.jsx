      <h2>Car rental in Ukraine</h2>
      <p>
        Arriving in Ukraine on business or as tourists, many people are faced
        with the problem of free movement around the city. Short or long-term
        car rental at RentedCars is the best alternative to public transport or
        taxi. You get complete freedom of movement: you can plan the route by
        yourself, so you don’t have to depend on the bus schedule or the time of
        car delivery.
        <br /> Our company has been working in this market segment for more than
        six years. During this time, an extensive fleet of modern vehicles was
        created and a dispatch service was organized. You can easily make a
        request and rent a car in every big city of Ukraine – just call our
        office by phone or contact us via the Internet. Do not miss the unique
        chance to inexpensively rent a car of the class you need with or without
        a driver!
